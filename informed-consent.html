        <h2><strong>Name of Study:</strong> Understanding Social Dynamics in the Social VR Rave Community</h2>
        <p><strong>Primary Author:</strong> Richard Lance Parayno</p>
        <p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Mascha Beuthel</p>
        <p><strong>Organizations</strong>: Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg and Salzburg University of Applied Sciences</p>
        <h3>Background and Purpose of the Study:</h3>
        <p>I am a Human-Computer Interaction researcher and MSc HCI graduate student (affiliation below) who wishes to understand the experiences and perceptions of people who attend and organize raves or club events in Social VR platforms like VRChat. This survey is a part of my Master thesis on Understanding Social Dynamics in the Social VR Rave Community.</p>
        <h3>Type of Research intervention and Participant Selection:</h3>
        <p>This research will involve your participation in either a survey questionnaire or participant interview. You were invited to participate because you satisfy at least one of the given criteria: (a) an 18+ Social VR user who has attended at least one "VR Rave" or "VR Club", (b) an 18+ Social VR user who has organized, moderated, or have been involved in organizing at least one "VR Rave" or "VR Club"</p>
        <h3>Voluntary Participation</h3>

        <h3>Risks and Benefits</h3>
        <p>There are no reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, or disadvantages connected to your participation. There will be no direct benefit to you, but your participation is likely to help us understand the design space of participants and organizers involved in Social VR raves. As a token of gratitude for your participation, you will be part of raffle where you can win digital cash vouchers that you can use at your convenience.</p>
        <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>We will not share your personal information to anyone outside of the research team. Your real name will be removed in all publications and outputs. Any information about you will be marked by a participant ID instead of your name. Only members of the research group will have access to personally identifiable data and all the information will be securely stored and destroyed when it is no longer needed.</p>
        <h3>Processing and Storing your Data</h3>
        <p>Your responses will be transcribed from the video recording (if applicable) and stored for data analysis. The data will be stored in a safe place at the investigators’ facility and only authorized personnel will have access to it. If a person’s identity can be disclosed from the any of the video recordings or online forms based on direct or indirect identifiers, it will be anonymized during analysis and will be destroyed by the end of the project (Q1 of 2024), while the response data will be kept only in the anonymized form.</p>
        <h3>Data Breach</h3>
        <p>In case of a data breach, the person responsible for data protection will be informed by the responsible researcher. Together they will undertake all steps necessary to minimize any negative consequences. You will receive a notification about the nature of the Data Breach, the information lost and the actions taken as soon as possible.</p>
        <h3>Your rights</h3>
        <p>You have the right to access your personal data, to correct it, to erase it, to restrict its processing, the right to data portability, and the right to object to in accordance with Articles 15-22 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, the right of erasure does not apply when the processing is necessary for the purposes of archiving that is in public interest, as well as the purposes of statistical analysis and scientific or historical research. You can also withdraw your consent to process your personal data at any time according to GDPR Article 6(1) and Article 9(2) without any consequences. Upon request your local supervisory authority will provide you information on exercising your rights according to Article 57(e) GDPR.</p>
        <h3>Usage of your data</h3>
        <p>Processed data will be used in research publications, for education purposes and for future research. The use will not be limited to the research group. Third parties will be able to access and process the anonymized data deposited on a private Google drive repository. As a participant you can receive a summary of the results upon request.</p>
